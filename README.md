# ðŸ¤– What is Feature?

Feature is a freelancing platform that facilitates the payment process in order to reward developers and contributors.&#x20;

Our vision is to encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, by being rewarded with cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

But you can still use Feature in private repositories to improve your software development productivity.

It is currently deployed on Gnosis Chain, Polygon and Arbitrum.
{% endhint %}

You can benefit from Feature services directly on Github. A Github bot parses your issues to create truly secure payments.
