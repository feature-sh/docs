# ðŸ¤– What is Feature?

Our vision is to encourage developers to contribute to projects on GitHub, by being rewarded with cryptocurrencies.

You can still use Feature to improve your software development productivity.

It is currently deployed on [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology) and [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io).
