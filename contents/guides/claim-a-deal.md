# ðŸ™‹ Claim a Deal

If the last comment is _"Anyone can claim by linking a PR to the issue."_ and nobody has claimed yet:

{% hint style="info" %}
If it's your **first time claiming**, you need to **link** your **GitHub account** with your
**wallet address**. In that case, **do step 1**. Then, the bot will ask you to do it.

After that, just **do step 1 again** and follow this tutorial.

{% endhint %}

1\) **Comment** the **number** with the keyword **`$feat`** of your **Pull Request**.

![Linking a PR to claim](../.gitbook/assets/claim\_command.png)


2\) **Click** on the link to be redirected to the **claiming page**.

3\) **Connect your wallet** and click on **Claim**.

4\) Once redirected on GitHub, the Feature bot will tell you that **you claimed successfully**!

{% hint style="info" %}
If nobody has challenged your claim within the challenge period, you will be able to [execute the deal](execute-a-deal.md) to receive your reward.
