# ⭐ Create a Certificat and badges

Certificates and badges are proof of success for developers in achieving the development of your application.

1) Access the certificate generator to create a custom certification.

A certificate contains an image, a symbol name and a icon.

The badge consists of an image and metadata. These will enhance the digital representation of your certification.

The details of a badge can be found by clicking on it.

4) Attribute a badge to a github user in the Github issue of a deal.

**Entitle** it or add a **comment** with this format: _$\<badge\_keyword> \<certificate_symbol> \<badge_name> \ <wallet_address_recipient> or \<@github-user>_.

The delivery request is in a Github comment of a registered repository, and contains the recipient's wallet address.  

For mint with username github preceded by @, open profile, in the top right dropdown menu, login to Metamask and prove ownership performing a signature in Metamask.

{% hint style="info" %}
The keywords to launch a mint of a badge are these: `$badge`.\
{% endhint %}

![Mint a badge](../.gitbook/assets/badge\_mint.png)

The one who mint with the returned message must be the ower of certificate on which the badge was edited and have the rights to his wallet address.   

You minted successfully!

5) Delete a certificate belonging to their Github organization.

The certificate can be deleted from the list of certificates. Deleting the certificate will delete the badges corresponding to it.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the certificate is deleted with its badges, these are kept on the blockchain with their properties and metadata.\
\
It is recommended that you save our smart-contract address of certificat to continue using them after this.
{% endhint %}

Once deleted, the Feature application does not keep them and no longer allows them to be returned to the dashboard.
