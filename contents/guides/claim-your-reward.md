If you made a Pull Request relative to the deal, you are ready to claim your reward:

{% hint style="info" %}
If it's your **first time claiming**, you need to **link** your **GitHub account** with your **wallet address**. In that case, **do step 1**. Then, the bot will ask you to do it.

After that, just **do step 1 again** and follow this tutorial.
