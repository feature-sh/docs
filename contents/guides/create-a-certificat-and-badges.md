# ⭐ Create a Certificat and badges

Certificates and badges are proof of success for developers in achieving the development of your application.

1) Access the certificate generator to create a custom certification.

A certificate contains an image and a symbol name along with being stamped.

{% hint style="info" %}
The choice of the blockchain and the owner of the NFT ERC721 is made with Metamask: `(polygon)`, `(xdai)` et `(arbitrum)`\
\
All the certificates of the different blockchains are listed there by user or organization.

2) Access the badge generator to create a badge.

Click on the three small dots of the certificate and select details for open the certificat détails.

3) Use the badge generator to create a personalized certification badge.

The badge consists of an image and metadata. Complete the information that describes the badge with a description and attributes. These will enhance the digital representation of your certification.

Validate the properties of your badge to add it to your collection. The details of a badge can be found by clicking on it.

5) Attribute a badge to a github user in the Github issue of a deal.

**Entitle** it or add a **comment** with this format: _$\<badge\_type> \<certificate_symbol> \<badge_name> or \<@github-user>_.

The message from the badge issuer contains the recipient's wallet address.  

{% hint style="info" %}
The keywords to launch a mint of a badge are these: `$badge and $bg`.\
{% endhint %}

![Mint a badge](../.gitbook/assets/badge\_mint.png)

The minter must be the receiver and have the rights to his wallet address to be able to mint a badge.  

The success of the transaction by your wallet confirms that the badge has been minted for its recipient. You minted successfully!

4) Delete a certificate belonging to their Github organization.

The certificate can be deleted from the list of certificates. Deleting the certificate will delete the badges corresponding to it.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the certificate is deleted with its badges, these are kept on the blockchain with their properties and metadata.\
\
Their uses are possible by other application or directly from the labels of a blockchain explorer.\
\
It is recommended that you save your smart-contract address to continue using them.
{% endhint %}

Once deleted, the Feature application does not keep them and no longer allows them to be returned to the dashboard.
